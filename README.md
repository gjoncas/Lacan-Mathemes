# Lacanian Mathemes in Ti𝑘Z
The idea with this repository is to provide open-source Ti𝑘Z diagrams of Lacan’s mathemes.
<br>Anyone using LaTeX can copy & paste this code into their papers to display the diagrams.

If you have any ideas for improvements, just file an <a href="https://github.com/gjoncas/Lacan-Mathemes/issues">issue</a> or pull request.
<br>However, I’m <i>not</i> providing free tech support. For small changes, see <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/PGF/TikZ">here</a> and <a href="http://mirror.ctan.org/graphics/pgf/base/doc/pgfmanual.pdf">here</a>.

Some of these are finished, others are passable but still a work in progress.
